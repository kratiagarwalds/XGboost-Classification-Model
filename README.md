# XGboost-Classification-Model
Space has always been a mistery. Scientists all around the world has always been eager to know what all planets are there in the galaxy. 
This project uses XGboost algorithm to create a model which predicts whether a star has a planet around it or not based upon its flux levels.

Materials and Methods:

*In this project, we have used a data driven approach to create a **supervised learning** model. The dataset used contains different levels of flux(intensity of brightness) of a star at different time intervals and one column "label" indicates whether the star has a planet around it or not.

*The model has been created using **XGboost algorithm** and has been evalueated by creating **confusion matrix** and **classification report** for the same. To balance out the labels column we have also used **smote** class which is helping in removing errors we get while working with imbalanced data.

*We have also created some **scatter plots and line plots** for better understanding how the levels of flux looks for stars those who have planets around them and for those who do not have planets around them

Results:

We can see that the model is able to predict accurately when a star has a planet around it. It would help a great deal in detecting more planets in the galaxy by measuring the flux of those stars.
